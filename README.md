You can download the latest version of Chart.js on [GitHub](https://github.com/chartjs/Chart.js/releases/tag/v4.2.1).

If you download or clone the repository, you must [build](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/developers/contributing.html#building-and-testing) Chart.js to generate the dist files. Chart.js no longer comes with prebuilt release versions, so an alternative option to downloading the repo is strongly advised.
